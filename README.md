## genjeweled

based off of popcap/ea's bejeweled series, this project aims to:

- teach myself java, libgdx, game/software development
- recreate some good childhood memories and dreams of building something like this
- show others and hopefully make someone's evening

### roadmap

take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/jadeddelta/genjeweled/issues) board for what exactly
is coming in the future!

### contributing

this is mostly intended as a solo project, but i am completely wandering 
in the dark in terms of learning game development, proper structures, 
and more (and piecing together information i've learned online). so if 
you have any suggestions or know what I should do, feel free to make an 
issue! alternatively, you can add me @ jadey#6671 on discord to speak with 
me directly if you have any concerns.

### development

this is on hiatus until i can get my life together and try to make some time for 
this here and there, i've learned a lot since i've last worked on this and i
want to try and apply these new concepts here. :)
