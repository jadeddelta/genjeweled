## genjeweled

based off of popcap/ea's bejeweled series, this project aims to:

- teach myself java, libgdx, game/software development
- recreate some good childhood memories and dreams of building something like this
- show others and hopefully make someone's evening

### roadmap

take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/jadeddelta/genjeweled/issues) board for what exactly
is coming in the future!

### contributing

this is mostly intended as a solo project, but i am completely wandering 
in the dark in terms of learning game development, proper structures, 
and more (and piecing together information i've learned online). so if 
you have any suggestions or know what I should do, feel free to make an 
issue! alternatively, you can add me @ jadey#6671 on discord to speak with 
me directly if you have any concerns.

### development

i've tried to push out a commit per day, but on long days like refactoring 
or adding big things, it'll probably take longer. either way, this'll be in 
development for the foreseeable future (at least for my 100 days of coding 
challenge)
